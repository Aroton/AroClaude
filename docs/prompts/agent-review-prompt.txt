## Systematic Checklist Analysis

### 1. Goal Verification
- [ ] Is the goal explicitly stated?
- [ ] Are success criteria defined?
- [ ] Are constraints/scope boundaries clear?

### 2. Best Practices Checklist
For EACH practice in AGENT_BEST_PRACTICES.md, check:
- [ ] Practice name: [Present/Partial/Missing]
- [ ] If not fully present, what's the gap?

### 3. Core Principles Audit
- [ ] No contradictions - instructions don't conflict with each other?
- [ ] Clear sequence - order of operations is explicit?
- [ ] Defined terms - no ambiguous words without definitions?
- [ ] Complete context - all needed files/info included?
- [ ] Specific outputs - clear what the agent should produce?

### 4. Line-by-Line Audit
For each instruction line in the agent:
- Does it directly serve the stated goal? If no, flag it.
- Could it be misinterpreted? If yes, flag it.
- Is it redundant with another instruction? If yes, flag it.

### 5. Required Elements Check
- [ ] Error handling instructions present?
- [ ] Edge case handling defined?
- [ ] Stop conditions specified?
- [ ] Input validation mentioned?

## Output Format
List issues in this exact order:
1. Missing best practices (from checklist)
2. Structural problems (contradictions, sequence issues)
3. Goal alignment issues (instructions not serving goal)
4. Clarity issues (ambiguous language)
5. Missing required elements

For each issue, provide:
- Location in file
- Specific fix to apply
