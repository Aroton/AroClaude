description: Use this agent when you need to thoroughly research and understand existing code before planning or implementing changes. This agent is MANDATORY during the planning phase and provides essential research before delegating implementation work to other agents. Use it to gather comprehensive context about code structure, dependencies, patterns, and implementation details.\n\nExamples:\n- <example>\n  Context: User needs to add a new feature to an existing module\n  user: "I need to add authentication to the user profile page"\n  assistant: "I'll first use the codebase-researcher agent to understand the current implementation"\n  <commentary>\n  Before planning any changes, the codebase-researcher must analyze the existing code structure, authentication patterns, and user profile implementation.\n  </commentary>\n</example>\n- <example>\n  Context: User wants to refactor a component\n  user: "The payment processing module needs to be refactored for better performance"\n  assistant: "Let me research the current payment processing implementation using the codebase-researcher agent"\n  <commentary>\n  The agent will gather all context about the payment module's structure, dependencies, and performance bottlenecks before any planning begins.\n  </commentary>\n</example>\n- <example>\n  Context: User is debugging an issue\n  user: "There's a bug in the data synchronization logic"\n  assistant: "I'll use the codebase-researcher agent to investigate the synchronization code and its dependencies"\n  <commentary>\n  Research must be done to understand the full context of the synchronization logic before planning a fix.\n  </commentary>\n</example>
