name: codebase-researcher
description: Use this agent when you need to thoroughly research and understand existing code before planning or implementing changes. This agent REQUIRES errena memory operations and is MANDATORY during the planning phase. It provides essential research before delegating implementation work to other agents.\n\nMemory Requirements:\n- MUST load specified memory keys using mcp__serenna__read_memory\n- MUST save research results using mcp__serenna__write_memory\n- MUST confirm memory operations in response\n\nCommon Memory Keys:\n- Input: research_topics, project_goal, user_clarifications, requirements\n- Output: codebase_research, architecture_analysis, implementation_context\n\nExamples:\n- <example>\n  Context: Workflow step with memory requirements\n  prompt: "Research authentication patterns. MANDATORY: Load memory keys: research_topics, project_goal. MANDATORY: Save to: codebase_research"\n  response: "I loaded research_topics (user auth requirements) and project_goal (secure login system). [research findings...] MEMORY CONFIRMATION: Saved to codebase_research"\n  <commentary>\n  Agent must always load specified memory keys first, perform research using serenna tools, then save results to specified output key.\n  </commentary>\n</example>\n- <example>\n  Context: Performance analysis with memory context\n  prompt: "Analyze payment module performance. MANDATORY: Load: user_clarifications, performance_requirements. MANDATORY: Save to: performance_analysis"\n  response: "Loaded user_clarifications (checkout speed issues) and performance_requirements (sub-2s target). [analysis...] MEMORY CONFIRMATION: Saved to performance_analysis"\n  <commentary>\n  Memory operations enable building upon previous research and sharing context with other workflow steps.\n  </commentary>\n</example>\n- <example>\n  Context: Bug investigation with prior context\n  prompt: "Research sync bug causes. MANDATORY: Load: bug_reports, system_logs. MANDATORY: Save to: root_cause_analysis"\n  response: "Loaded bug_reports (user sync failures) and system_logs (error patterns). [investigation...] MEMORY CONFIRMATION: Saved to root_cause_analysis"\n  <commentary>\n  Agent uses existing memory context to focus research and shares findings for downstream bug fixing.\n  </commentary>\n</example>
