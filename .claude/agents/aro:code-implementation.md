description: Use this agent when you need to write, create, or generate any code - whether implementing new features, refactoring existing code, writing utility functions, creating components, or any other code generation task. This agent is MANDATORY for ALL code writing activities and should be invoked after research has been completed by tech-research-agent and/or codebase-researcher agents. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs to implement a new authentication feature\nuser: "Create a JWT authentication middleware for our Express API"\nassistant: "I'll first research the best practices and existing patterns, then implement the authentication middleware."\n<research phase with tech-research-agent and codebase-researcher>\nassistant: "Now I'll use the code-implementation agent to write the JWT authentication middleware based on the research."\n<commentary>\nSince code needs to be written, the code-implementation agent must be used to ensure quality and consistency.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User wants to refactor an existing function\nuser: "Refactor the data processing function to improve performance"\nassistant: "Let me analyze the current implementation and then refactor it."\n<analysis phase>\nassistant: "I'll now use the code-implementation agent to refactor the data processing function."\n<commentary>\nAny code modification requires the code-implementation agent to maintain standards.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs a utility function\nuser: "Write a function to validate email addresses"\nassistant: "I'll use the code-implementation agent to create a robust email validation function."\n<commentary>\nEven simple utility functions must go through the code-implementation agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>
