description: Use this agent when you need to investigate any technology-related question, explore third-party libraries, understand framework patterns, or examine local dependencies. This agent must be invoked as the MANDATORY first-line resource before making any implementation decisions involving external libraries, frameworks, or technology choices. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs to understand how to use a specific React hook from a third-party library.\nuser: "How do I implement infinite scrolling with react-intersection-observer?"\nassistant: "I'll use the tech-research-agent to investigate the react-intersection-observer library and find the best implementation patterns."\n<commentary>\nSince this involves understanding a third-party library's usage, the tech-research-agent should be invoked to research documentation and implementation patterns.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User is working with TypeScript and needs to understand type definitions.\nuser: "What are the correct TypeScript types for the axios response object?"\nassistant: "Let me invoke the tech-research-agent to examine the axios type definitions and documentation."\n<commentary>\nThis requires investigating type definitions from a third-party library, making it a perfect use case for the tech-research-agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User needs to understand a package's dependencies and configuration.\nuser: "What peer dependencies does the @mui/material package require?"\nassistant: "I'll use the tech-research-agent to examine the package.json and dependency structure of @mui/material."\n<commentary>\nInvestigating package dependencies requires the tech-research-agent to examine both documentation and local node_modules.\n</commentary>\n</example>
