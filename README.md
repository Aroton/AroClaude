# Specialized Development Agents

This project benefits from specialized agents that provide battle-tested patterns for AI validation testing, code analysis, and rapid development.

## Available Agents

### Implementation & Architecture Agents
- **@aro:code-implementation**: MANDATORY for all code writing. Creates production-ready implementations with quality assurance.
- **@aro:tech-research-agent**: MANDATORY first-line for technology questions. Researches libraries, frameworks, and best practices.
- **@aro:codebase-researcher**: MANDATORY for planning stages. Maps architecture and provides comprehensive context.
- **@aro:implementation-planner**: Creates phased implementation roadmaps from research and requirements.
- **@aro:architecture-designer**: Designs comprehensive system architectures from requirements and research.

### Testing & Quality Agents
- **@aro:acceptance-criteria-agent**: Generates testable acceptance criteria from code or requirements. Maintains living documentation synchronized with implementation.
- **@aro:automated-code-reviewer**: Performs security and quality analysis. Reviews code against best practices, identifies vulnerabilities, and suggests improvements.

## AI Validation Workflow

These agents work together in a streamlined AI validation development flow:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: The @aro:acceptance-criteria-agent analyzes requirements or existing code to generate clear acceptance criteria.

2. **Research**: The @aro:tech-research-agent and @aro:codebase-researcher gather necessary context and patterns.
3. **Implementation**: The @aro:code-implementation agent creates production-ready code with:
   - Clean, maintainable solutions following project patterns
   - Comprehensive documentation and type safety
   - Quality validation through linting and testing

4. **Validation**: Create pragmatic tests to ensure functionality:
   - Sanity tests for critical paths
   - Edge case coverage where needed
   - Integration point validation

5. **Review**: The @aro:automated-code-reviewer performs quality checks for security, performance, and maintainability.

6. **Architecture Planning**: For complex features, @aro:implementation-planner and @aro:architecture-designer provide structured guidance.

## Agent Philosophy

- **Implementation First**: Ship features quickly with minimal testing overhead
- **Minimal Validation**: Maximum 3 integration tests per feature to catch critical issues
- **Phased Implementation**: Complex work broken into validated phases
- **Research First**: Analyze multiple approaches before recommending solutions
- **Aggressive Deletion**: Remove obsolete code when backwards compatibility isn't needed
- **Rapid Development**: Focus on delivering working solutions fast
- **Living Documentation**: Acceptance criteria stay synchronized with code

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Start with well-defined requirements
2. **Implementation-First Development**: Build working solutions, then add minimal validation
3. **Small Iterations**: Work in small, verifiable increments
4. **Minimal Testing**: Only test what's critical to prevent major failures
5. **Documentation as Code**: Keep acceptance criteria in version control

The agents excel at rapid, practical development. They follow an efficient approach that prioritizes shipping working features with just enough validation to prevent AI-generated errors.
