## AI Validation Workflow

These agents work together in a streamlined AI validation development flow:

1. **Requirements Analysis**: The @acceptance-criteria-agent analyzes requirements or existing code to generate clear acceptance criteria.

2. **Implementation**: The @ai-validation-writer implements features with an implementation-first approach, focusing on:
   - Understanding requirements and building working solutions
   - Writing clean, maintainable code
   - Handling core functionality and edge cases

3. **Minimal Validation**: Create maximum 3 integration tests per feature to catch AI-generated errors:
   - Core functionality validation
   - Critical edge cases
   - Integration points

4. **Review**: The @automated-code-reviewer performs quality checks for security, performance, and maintainability.

5. **Architecture Planning**: For complex features, @implementation-planner and @architecture-designer provide structured guidance before implementation.

## Agent Philosophy

- **Implementation First**: Ship features quickly with minimal testing overhead
- **Minimal Validation**: Maximum 3 integration tests per feature to catch critical issues
- **Phased Implementation**: Complex work broken into validated phases
- **Research First**: Analyze multiple approaches before recommending solutions
- **Aggressive Deletion**: Remove obsolete code when backwards compatibility isn't needed
- **Rapid Development**: Focus on delivering working solutions fast
- **Living Documentation**: Acceptance criteria stay synchronized with code

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Acceptance Criteria**: Start with well-defined requirements
2. **Implementation-First Development**: Build working solutions, then add minimal validation
3. **Small Iterations**: Work in small, verifiable increments
4. **Minimal Testing**: Only test what's critical to prevent major failures
5. **Documentation as Code**: Keep acceptance criteria in version control

The agents excel at rapid, practical development. They follow an efficient approach that prioritizes shipping working features with just enough validation to prevent AI-generated errors.
